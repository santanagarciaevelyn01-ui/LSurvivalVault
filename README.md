## 🔭 Overview

Standard storage plugins often instantiate physical prefabs under the map to trick the game into opening an inventory. This causes unnecessary collision checks (`BoxCollider`) and rendering overhead.

**LSurvival Vault** uses a **Ghost Identity Architecture**:
It injects a virtual asset identity (Asset ID 1283) into the network stream to trigger the native UI, while the storage object itself remains a "naked" GameObject in RAM without physics or mesh renderers.

> **Result:** 100% Native UI experience with **0% Physics Impact**.

## 🚀 Technical Refactoring & Optimization

Following a strict code audit, the engine has been rewritten to address common Unity lifecycle pitfalls and concurrency issues often found in legacy plugins.

### 🔧 Fixed Architectural Bottlenecks
* **Elimination of `FixedUpdate` Polling:** Previous iterations relied on the physics loop (50Hz) for timer checks, creating unnecessary CPU overhead. This has been refactored to use native **Coroutines/Invokes**, freeing up valuable ticks for the game engine.
* **Main Thread Unblocking:** I/O operations (saving to disk) previously caused micro-stutters. The new **Snapshot Pattern** captures memory state in microseconds on the main thread and offloads the heavy write operations to a background `Task`, ensuring smooth gameplay even during auto-saves.
* **Asset Identity Crash Fix:** Resolved `NullReferenceException` issues related to virtual storages lacking asset definitions by implementing a robust **Mock Barricade Injection** pipeline.

💖 Acknowledgments
Special recognition to Midnight for the high-level technical audit. Your insights regarding the Unity Lifecycle optimization (specifically the removal of the FixedUpdate loop) and the recommendation for Async I/O patterns were instrumental in refactoring this plugin from a standard script into a professional, optimized system.
