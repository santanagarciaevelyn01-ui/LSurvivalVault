## 🔭 Overview

**LSurvival Vault** replaces traditional physical storage (barricades) with a virtualized system. By not instantiating physical objects in the game world, it eliminates collision calculations and unnecessary rendering, significantly improving server performance while offering a modern user experience.

> **Core Philosophy:** Seamless integration, atomic data integrity, and combat-aware mechanics.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🧠 In-Memory Operation** | Generates virtual containers in RAM via dependency injection. No physical barricades, no lag. |
| **🛡️ Combat Manager** | Monitors damage events. If a player takes PvP damage, access to the vault is locked for a configurable duration. |
| **💾 LiteDB Persistence** | Uses **LiteDB v5** (NoSQL). Replaces fragile flat files with transactional, atomic database operations. |
| **🔄 Auto-Save** | Asynchronous background saving every 60 seconds (configurable) to minimize data loss during crashes. |
| **👮 Admin Tools** | Real-time inspection. Admins can open offline players' vaults or "spy" on active vaults with shared memory updates. |
| **📈 Scalability** | Supports up to **18 independent vaults** per player, each with custom dimensions (Width x Height). |

## 📋 Technical Specifications

### Storage Architecture (Mock Storage)
* **Dynamic Positioning:** The virtual container dynamically positions itself relative to the player to satisfy server-side distance checks without physical instantiation.
* **Zero Collision:** Completely removes the physics overhead associated with standard metal lockers or crates.

### Data Integrity
* **Atomic Transactions:** Read/Write operations are transaction-safe.
* **Unified Storage:** All data is centralized in a single, portable file:  
    `.../Plugins/LSurvivalVault/Data/LSurvivalVault.db`
